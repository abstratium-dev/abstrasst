# abstrassist

**abstrassist** is an application that provides AI-powered assistance. Built on the Quarkus subatomic Java stack, Quinoa for seamless integration, and Angular for the frontend, it serves as the upstream source for all specific project forks.

## 📦 Tech Stack

Runtime: Quarkus (Java)

Frontend UI: Angular (via Quinoa)

API Layer: REST

Auth: Integrated with Abstrauth

Data: Designed for MySql compatibility

## 🛠️ Getting Started

This project is based on the Abstracore template. To sync with baseline updates from Abstracore:

```bash
# From the project root, run the sync script
bash scripts/sync-base.sh
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Avoid modifying the `/core` directory in your project forks. Keep your custom logic in `/app` or specific feature packages to minimize merge conflicts during updates.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

src/main/java/...: Core logic, security filters, and Abstrauth integration.

src/main/webui: The Angular application (managed by Quinoa).

docker/: Standardized deployment configurations.

scripts/: Automation for syncing with Abstracore.

## 🚀 Development Mode

Run the following command to start Quarkus in Dev Mode with the Angular live-reload server:

```bash
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```
Backend: http://localhost:8084

Frontend: Automatically proxied by Quinoa

Dev UI: http://localhost:8084/q/dev

## 📝 Governance

This is a Living Blueprint. If you develop a feature in a specific project (like a new logging service or UI utility) that would benefit all Abstratium apps, please back-port it to Abstracore via a Pull Request.

## Things to remember

- **Backend For Frontend (BFF) Architecture** - This service must act as a BFF if it has a UI. It is the BFF for that UI.
- **Native Builds** - This service must be built as a native image (GraalVM) for optimal performance and low footprint.
- **Low footprint** - uses as little as 64MB RAM and a small amount of CPU for typical workloads, idles at near zero CPU, achieved by being built as a native image (GraalVM)
- **Based on Quarkus and Angular** - industry standard frameworks
