# TODOs for Abstracore (to be deleted downstream)

- add a banner for non-prod envs with a custom string to warn users that they are not using prod
- add observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
- fix tracking of the url in the auth service, so that if the user clicks or enters a link, they are redirected, regardless of whether they are already signed in, or need to sign in
